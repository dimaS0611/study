                                    On the rebound from a slate of injuries, Drouin greets Tokyo postponement with cautious optimism
                                </h1>
                                <p>
                                    <br />Nobody could have blamed Derek Drouin for greeting the news of the postponed Olympic Games with a fist pump, a high five and a cartwheel.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Virtually invisible from the sport since tearing his achilles tendon at the 2017 Diamond League meeting in Oslo, the Olympic high jump champion has been bedevilled by serious injury, which threatened to push the 1.94m tall Canadian into premature retirement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since his ill-fated appearance in the Norwegian capital, the 2015 world champion has been restricted to just three low-key competitions through a combination of two achilles tears and a serious spinal nerve injury which has threatened to permanently derail his career.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Yet despite the lows, he has refused to quit. Currently on the road back to full fitness, the news that the Tokyo Olympics has been pushed back a year following the Covid-19 pandemic buys the articulate Canadian the precious commodity of extra time.
                                </p>

                                    “I had planned to come out and do some indoor meets (this year) but I felt the clock was ticking (to get an Olympic qualification mark),” says Drouin.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    “I’m not going to lie, I was relieved for my own personal reasons that I had another year (to prepare for the Tokyo Games), although having said that I was also really hoping I would have the opportunity to jump this summer (and I’m not sure that is going to be the case).”
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Drouin emerged as a world-class athlete in 2012 by winning a share of the bronze at the London Olympics. The following year he repeated the same podium spot at the World Championships in Moscow before embarking on a three-year unbeaten streak of major championship success by striking gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, 2015 Pan American Games and World Championships and 2016 Rio Olympics.
